      Hi!
      <br>
      I am Shashank. My friends call me Banana.
      <br>
      I am a "Software Engineer".
      <br>
      As of today, I have a 4-year bachelor's degree in computer science
      and a little over two years of professional experience.
      <br>
      But even after 6 years of "Being in the Industry", I feel like I'm lacking.
    </p>
    <p>
       I realize now, that all these years I've just been browsing.
      <br>
      Today, I have decided to start for real, delve deeper, and understand better.
      <br>
      So I'm writting this blog to track my progress.
      <br>
      Today, I have started these things:
      <ol>
        <li>Algorithms and Data Structures from <a href="https://www.edx.org/">edx</a></li>
        <li>Solving questions on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">hackerrank</a></li>
        <li>HTML5 track on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a></li>
        <li>Making my website on <a href = "https://github.com/">github<a></li>
        <li>Writing this BLOG</li>
      </ol>

      This is my first blog post ever, but it is a blog post nonetheless.
      <br>
      I will document anything I find interesting here and hope it helps other people along the way.
      <br>
      Ciao!!
